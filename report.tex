\abstract{The project aims to explore how changes in light imperfections impact the realism of a BZ simulation as it's scaled in size. The code is in Metal/GPU and runs experiments varying different simulation parameters that correspond to real-world changes, and then measures results. Changes in light were found to significantly impact the correct behaviour of BZ computer simulations and more advanced light management tools such as LED panels are required to scale large BZ circuits.}
