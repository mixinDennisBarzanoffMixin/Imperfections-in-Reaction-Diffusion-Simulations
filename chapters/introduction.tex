\chapter{Introduction}
Reaction diffusion is a field of science that has seen rapid innovations in the areas of image processing \citep{kuhnert1989image} and chemical computing \todo{ref}. Among the numerous computing approaches, it has emerged as an alternative that takes advantage of the intrinsic ability of chemically reactive circuits to process information similar to that of computers. 
Although there is much potential there, most research focusses on building circuits in a simulation, such as \cite{StovoldJames2019RaGI}, versus in real life, such as \cite{gorecki2003chemical}. It is unclear whether exactly how the simulation maps to real life in terms of size and environmental factors that are likely to impact it.
