abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

    abstract = "{A number of nonmonotonic behaviors appear when the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is run in a flow system (CSTR) which are not observed when the reaction is run in a closed system. Among these behaviors is composite double oscillation in which nearly identical bursts of oscillation are separated by regular periods of quiescence. Here we use a modified version of the oregonator model of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction to simulate composite double oscillation. Our modification involves the addition of a new variable which is related to the amount of brominated organic material present in the system. This new variable changes slowly on the time scale of the oscillations and controls the value of f, the stoichiometric factor of step 5 in the oregonator. Thus the behavior of the modified oregonator in CSTR mode when flowrates are moderate can be rationalized in terms of the properties of the unmodified oregonator in a closed system. We show that composite double oscillation is a hysteresis phenomenon occurring over a small range of values of f where a locally stable steady state and a locally stable limit cycle coexist. Composite double oscillation occurs as the system is carried back‐and‐forth across the area of coexistence by the new, slowly moving variable whose concentration grows during the oscillatory phase, when the system is on the locally stable limit cycle, and decays during the quiescent phase, when the system is on the locally stable steady state.}",

abstract = {This paper presents RDCSim, an interactive simulator for reaction--diffusion
chemistry (RDC) research, being developed as part of an ongoing project
studying how humans interact with unconventional computing systems.
While much research into the computational properties of RDC makes use of
simulations, the development of multiple RDC simulations across different
research groups can lead to results that are harder to reproduce. By automating
the storage of parameter values alongside simulation results, RDCSim aims to
make reproducing RDC results painless.
This paper presents the functionality of RDCSim, and verifies the behaviour
of the underlying chemical simulation using two seminal examples from the RDC
literature: logical AND gates and chemical diodes.},

Binary collisions between wave fragments in a sub-excitable Belousov–Zhabotinsky medium. Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals 2007;34:307–15]. We have reproduced in chemical experiments the majority of the collisions observed in simulation including annihilation, fusion and quasi-elastic types. The method we present is capable of implementing information transfer without any rigidly controlled architecture – fragments are simply introduced into an “arena” which consists of a large area of gel illuminated with a uniform light level – controlled at a level close to the sub-excitable threshold. Therefore, the fragments of excitation both pre and post collision possess a considerable freedom of movement when compared to previous implementations of information transfer in chemical systems. This chemical verification of previous theoretical results brings closer the possibility of utilising this phenomenon for implementing collision-based gates, signal tuning and programming of collision-based computers based upon excitable chemical reactions.}
